## My VSCode config

-   After one time fixing my laptop and losing all the data, i realized saving vscode config is very important. But, i seemingly don't like [setting-sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync) so i decided to export my vscode config as json file, and in the future, i can recover it if necessary. However, in this way, if i change my vscode config, i must backup my data again manumally, so i don't encourage follow my way, you should use [setting-sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync).

## Usage

#### 1. Recover setting.json

-   Copy and parse setting.json to new vscode setting.json

#### 2. Recover extensions

-   Open terminal and run shell file

```
./extension.sh
```
