- The difference between censor and censorship is the kind of words. "Censor" can be nouns or verbs, whereas "censorship" can be only nouns. If "censor" is a noun, it represents someone, the person has a right to examine something belonging to someone else. If "censor" is a verb, it mentions an action in which someone has a right to examine something belonging to someone else. The meaning of "censorship" is quite complex, it is a noun and it mentions the practice while someone censors someone else. From my point of view, "censorship" is the same as "censor" but it is considered from the outside perspective. For more obvious, i have a trivial example below.

- I assume A is a writer and B is a publisher. A has a novel book and he wants his book will be published by B. Because of some magic reasons, B needs to examine A's book content before considering the publication. In this context, B is a censor, the action that B examine A's book content can be stated: "B censor A's book content". You are an outsider, when you see this above action, you are seeing a censorship practice.
